# JPACRUDProject
## Description
For my JPA CRUD project I created a full-stack application that deploys to a local server. The page itself is connected to a database for some of Colorado's Fourteeners (mountains that have an elevation above 14,000 ft). On the homepage the user has the option search for mountains by name or number. 

When on the page that displays the information about the mountain, the user is given the option the delete or update or return back to the homepage. If the user chooses to delete or update it will then relocate the user to the appropriate page for them to do so. The full list is available on the home page which allows the user to see all the changes being made to the data.

## Technologies Used

## Concepts Applied
- ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
- JPQL (Jakarta Persistence Query Language) querying
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Spring boot integration
- Modeling SQL relationships

## Lessons Learned
Putting a full-stack application together over the course of two days by yourself is no joke. However, utilizing modern frameworks like Spring and Hibernate really help simplify a lot of processes/code that a week or two ago would have taken much more time and effort. It's true that I'm fulfilling the path of a developer as I embrace the virtue of being impatient. 

Ultimately I would say the biggest lesson learned here was good things take time and brain power, and also when using MySQLWorkBench, hit "apply changes" at least 1000x before closing the application.
